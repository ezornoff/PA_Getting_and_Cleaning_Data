## Course Project Getting and Cleaning Data - Johns Hopkins University

The script is on run_alaysis.R file and it runs depending on dplyt, stringi and plyr libraries.

The tidy data files are tidyData.txt for the data and tidyDataSum.txt for the summarized data (mean of each variable) for the combination of subject and activity descriprion.

There's a CodeBook.md that walks through the logic of the computation with the code and the head of data files.

Data description on each variable are already on the features.txt on the original dataset.

Thank you for your attention and enjoy.
